Situated in spectacular countryside, just east of Haldon Hills, Hyperion is just a 10 minute drive from Exeter city centre offering a full selection of livery services alongside a comprehensive breaking and schooling service for horses and ponies.</p><p>Hyperion combines first class professional facilities with a caring and relaxed atmosphere. The horses and their owners are their top priority and their aim is to provide a service where both can realise their potential and enjoy their time with them.  Hyperion is a BHS "Where to Train" centre.  With a record in competition and training, Hyperion offers an excellent service for horses, riders and students</br></br> As an outreach yard for Duchy College Stoke Climsland, offers training in the industry for Horse Care Work-Based Diploma Level 1, 2 and 3.  These courses are suitable for anyone who wishes to study horse care in the work place rather than attending a fulltime college course.</p><p>These courses are especially good as they are practical based training in the industry. There are no exams at the end of the programme, it is all achieved by assessments and building a portfolio on evidence.  The programme allows you to work at your own pace and courses are full or part-time to suit.</p></p>

                        <p class="outreach-centre p" > <p class="lead">Courses at the Heaven Scent Nursery at Wheal Martyn are designed for adult learners who will benefit from a relaxed and informal environment in which to build skills and knowledge in horticulture and conservation.  Starting at entry level and progressing to Level 2, these part-time practical courses are a great way to get fit, feel good, and gain a vocational qualification that can help in securing employment.  The environment is particularly suited to anyone who might find attendance at one of the main college campuses difficult.</p><p>Courses cover sustainable horticulture, wildlife gardening, organic gardening methods, garden maintenance, propagation and health and safety.  This is a small working nursery so there is also the opportunity to develop important employability and enterprise skills. Working as part of a group in a supportive environment helps to improve confidence and independence as well as  communication skills.</p></p>

Hannah’s at Seale-Hayne is an inspiring and creative community space for learners of all abilities. </p><p>Duchy and Hannah’s recognise the challenges faced by people of all abilities in the quest for employment and share a passion for the way in which social enterprise can offer opportunities for the development of employability skills in a supportive and inclusive environment.  While learning about gardening in a very practical way, students will be helping to build a successful enterprise and will learn to work safely, to work as part of a group, to be more confident and independent and to communicate well with others. </p><p>These courses are accredited through City and Guilds so some time is spent in the classroom building a portfolio of evidence - a great opportunity to work on English and computer skills at the same time. </p></p>
